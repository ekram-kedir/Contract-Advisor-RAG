# Contract-Advisor-RAG
# Overview

Lizzy AI is an early-stage Israeli startup focused on developing advanced contract AI technology. Our goal is to create the first fully autonomous artificial contract lawyer. Initially, we aim to build a powerful contract assistant capable of drafting, reviewing, and negotiating contracts independently, with the ultimate goal of developing a fully autonomous contract bot.

# Task Objective
Our task is to build, evaluate, and enhance a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system for Contract Q&A. This system will enable users to interact with contracts by asking questions and receiving relevant responses. By leveraging large language models and external data retrieval, we aim to enhance the system's accuracy and provide context-rich outputs.

# Background

- What is RAG?
  - Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a hybrid AI model that combines powerful language models with external data sources. It retrieves relevant information 
  from external data before generating responses, resulting in more accurate and context-rich outputs.

- Why RAG?
  - RAG offers an exciting opportunity to create sophisticated AI systems capable of interacting with vast amounts of information. Building a robust RAG system 
  presents challenges but also opportunities for innovation and learning in the AI field.
