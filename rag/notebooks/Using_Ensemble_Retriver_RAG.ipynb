Without derogating from the foregoing, the Advisor shall not be required to provide the Services for a period of eighteen (18) days in each 12-month period. In performing the Services, Advisor shall devote his time, know-how, expertise, talent, experience and best efforts and attention to the provision of the Services, as shall be reasonably required by the Company. Advisor shall render the Services in a diligent manner and at a high professional standard for the benefit of the Company and shall perform and discharge well and faithfully, with devotion, honesty and fidelity, his obligations hereunder. Advisor further agrees and undertakes to (i) comply with all the Company\\'s policies, procedures and objectives, as in effect from time to time; (ii) adhere to any applicable law or provision, pertaining to his services; (iii) not take any action with the intention that the same will cause material damage to the good name of the Company; (iv) keep the contents of this Agreement confidential and not to disclose the existence or contents of this Agreement to any third party without the prior written consent of the Company.

No Conflicts: Advisor represents that there is no contractual or other legal restriction preventing or limiting him/her from entering into this Agreement or performing any of his/her obligations hereunder. Advisor shall immediately and without delay inform the Company of any affairs and/or matters that might constitute a conflict of interest with his/her services to Company and/or the interests of the Company. Advisor agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company and its directors, officers and employees against all claims, liabilities, and costs, including reasonable attorneys\\' fees in connection with any breach by Advisor, of any obligations pursuant to a prior or existing engagement with any other third party, including without limitation other employers or clients. Term: The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue until terminated in accordance with the provisions herein (the \"Term\"). Termination: Either party, at any given time, may terminate this Agreement, for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, upon fourteen (14) days’ prior written notice. Notwithstanding the above, the Company may terminate this Agreement immediately and without prior notice if Advisor refuses or is unable to perform the Services, or is in breach of any provision of this Agreement. Compensation:\\nAs full and sole consideration for the Services, and subject to the performance of the Services, the Company shall pay the Advisor, against an invoice provided to the Company by Advisor, hourly fees at a rate of USD 9 (nine) per Billable Hour as defined below, limited to a maximum of USD 1,500 per month (the \"Fees\"). In addition, the Company shall pay the advisor USD 100 per month to finance a workspace for the Advisor, as long as the Advisor actually hires a professional workspace (the “Workspace Expense”). Advisor will not be entitled to any additional fees or expense reimbursement whatsoever, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement.
