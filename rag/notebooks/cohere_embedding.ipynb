This is unless the contract specifically states so. This is done to preserve the rights and obligations of the original parties to the contract. However, there are some exceptions to this rule, for example in the case of mergers or acquisitions, where a third party may be assigned an agreement by operation of law. \\n\\nIt is recommended that you review the terms of the specific agreement you are dealing with and consult a legal professional specialized in contracts for precise advice. \\n\\nThis is meant to provide you with some helpful introductory insights into the general aspects of contract assignment.'"

      "5. Consent Requirements: If consent is needed for an assignment, this is stated, along with any conditions or limitations on granting or withholding consent. \n",
